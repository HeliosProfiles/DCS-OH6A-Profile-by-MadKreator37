# Helios Profile for OH-6A Cayuse (Community Mod) by MadKreator37

### Minimum Helios version required: 1.6.6110.0005
### Please download and install via the Helios16 installer under ASSETS. Do not clone the repo and copy the files. The profile will not function correctly!

This is a Helios profile for the amazing OH-6A Community Mod, created by Tobsen and Eightball, designed for DCS World and contributed by @MadKreator37 and @Bluefinbima. 
This profile utilizes an aircraft specifc interface which was written into the Helios Virtual Cockpit project.  This can be downloaded from [Helios latest release](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest)

There are 2 profiles included. One for day and one for night. Although they are separate, there is a button to swap between them without having to use Control Center.

Both profiles need to be set up separately after they are downloaded and installed. 

After initial install, you will be shown the following screen instructing you to open each profile and set them up individually. It will not autoimatically open them for setup like normal.

### IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!
 NEW USERS:The patches for the RWR export and the adjusted file for the Fuel Control Valve to function properly are now included in the download and will be automatically applied via "DCS Additional Viewports". You will need to "Revert" then "Install" patches while setting up the profile.
 EXISTING USERS of V1.0.5: No changes should be needed. 1.0.6 will only contain the patch changes. You may want to update just to have the Patches Folder added to the Helios Library for future use.

 IF you encounter any issues: Uninstall the mod, reinstall the vanilla version without the modified files. Install profile V 1.0.6. Revert and Install the patches.
  
  Patching of User Mods in Saved Games is a newly added feature. Please report any bugs or issues so we can work out a good routine on current and future profiles.


### ABOUT
This profile was designed and created by myself, in close collaboration with BlueFin. All parts were cut and modified from the 3d model of the OH-6A cockpit and texture files. Every piece used is specific to the OH-6A.  The hope is to bring you the most complete, visually appealing and easy to use profile for the OH-6A Cayuse in DCS that we could. There are several added functions in the profile, such as buttons for the F-10 map, rearm/refuel window, briefing menu, f-keys, Kneeboard functions, doors, gunsight, visor etc. 

*NOTE*: The added functions:  F-keys Esc, Rearm, Briefing, Kneeboard etc buttons require the default DCS keybindings for them to work properly. If you have altered any of these then some functions may not work as intended.

### Notes

-Due to the wide range of displays, monitors, TV's and tablets,  I cannot guarantee exact brightness levels or color accuracy results from user to user. This is not something I have any control of. If you have visual issues (too bright or too dark etc)  please calibrate your display and/or adjust settings in your GPU's software, brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, digital vibrance etc.(highly recommended anyway). It will probably enhance all other profiles as well. During testing, the profile was used and shown on multiple displays, and types,  to rule out any "game breaking" visuals but it is impossible for me to account for every scenario.

-*Remember to always make a back up of files before making changes*
