* Patches / DCS Community directory
This directory contains patches - generally for Community modules - which are for 
modules stored in the DCS installation's working folder - typically 
'%userprofile%\Saved Games\DCS`.
The patches are using two files, a patch and a revert, and these are in the 
form for Google's DiffMatchPatch.  Complete file replacements are not supported.
