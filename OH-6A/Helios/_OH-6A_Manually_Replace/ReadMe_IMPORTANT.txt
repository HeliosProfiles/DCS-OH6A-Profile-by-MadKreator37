These files need replaced in order for the Fuel Valve in the profile to work, and to allow the RWR to be exported( when its turned on in ME). The Oh-6A dev is working with us to incorporate these into the mod. I will release a new profile version when these are no longer needed. Keep an eye on the release notes in future updates.



Please place the provided folder, "Mods" , into the directory path shown in the attached screenshot. <install location>/OH-6A. 

The screenshot with RED is where it would be placed in the SavedGames folder, if that is where you installed it.

If you use OVGME or  other mod manager, place the files in there instead, so they wont get overwritten. The screenshot with GREEN is my OVGME install directory, for an example.
